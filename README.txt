Instructions to run the lab
    Use the command tar -xf lab5.tar.gz -C <directory path> to extract the folder lab5 to another directory.
    Or just use tar -xf lab5.tar.gz to unzip the tar file. Just run the command make in the lab5 directory. 
    Then a shell executable should be made in that directory. Now just enter shell and press enter. The history
    file is present within this directory, but the contents should not be messed with. If they are, this program
    will not work because it depends on the specific way that the history file is organized!
